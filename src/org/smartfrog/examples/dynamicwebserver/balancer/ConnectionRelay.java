/**
 * ConnectionRelay moves data between all of the paired client and server
 * socket connections for a specifc Server. It uses asynchronous IO functions
 * to minimize the number of threads in the system. It works by using a
 * selector to detect when either a client or server socket is available for
 * reading. It then reads the data from the socket and attempts to write the
 * data to the paired socket. If the data cannot be written, because the write
 * buffer of the paired socket is full, it deselects the socket just read from
 * from the selector to prevent additional data from being read, and shedules
 * a write operation with the DelayedWriter instance. DelayedWriter waits for
 * the paired socket to become writable again and writes the data to it. When
 * all of the data has been written, the original socket is reenabled for
 * reading to read more data. There is one instance of
 * ConnectionRelay/DelayedWriter for each Server. ConnectionRelay and
 * DelayedWriter each have their own thread to handle data movement between
 * the paired sockets for clients connected to the coresponding server. There
 * 2 threads are started per server in the system.

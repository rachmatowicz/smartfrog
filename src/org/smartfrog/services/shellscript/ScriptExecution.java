/**
 * Interface that provides the API to the script component, allowing
 * other co-located components to submit script commands.
 *
 * The interface provides for the submission of lines of script and the
 * ability to lock a script component for unique use for a period. This ensures
 * that sequences of script commands will not be interleaved with other
 * script requets to the component.
 *
 * The operational model is asynchronous, in that the execute operation only queues
 * the execute request and does not wait until it is complete. An object implementing
 * the ScriptResult interface is returned, and this can be queried to find if the script has
 * completed and obtain the resultant output, both error and normal.
 *
 * Commands to be executed are passed in as a list the following format.
 * Each element is either a string, in which case it is treated as a command, or
 * a list in which case the command is the space-separated "toString" of its elements.

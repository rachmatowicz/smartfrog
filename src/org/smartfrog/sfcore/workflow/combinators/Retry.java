/**
 * Retry is a modified compound which differs in that its single sub-component

 * combinator creates no subcomponents until it's sfStart phase at which point
 * all the subcomponent is created in the normal way. The Retry combinator
 * waits for its sub-component to terminate normally at which point it too
 * terminates normally. If an error occurs at any point, or a sub-component is
 * retried unless a limit is reached in which case it too terminates
 * abnormally.
 *
 * <p>
 * The file retry.sf contains the SmartFrog configuration file for the base
 * Retry combinator. This file conatins the details of the attributes which

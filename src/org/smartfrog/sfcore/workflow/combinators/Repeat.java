 * Repeat is a modified compound which differs in that its single sub-component

 * The Repeat combinator terminates normally if the sub-component has
 * terminated normally a given number of times, and abnormally whenever the
 * component terminates abnormally. The file repeat.sf contains the SmartFrog
 * configuration file for the base Repeat combinator. This file conatins the

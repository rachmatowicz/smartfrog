/**
 * This is the default include handler for the SmartFrog parser. This simply
 * creates a new parser and returns an AttributeList. The include name is
 * located using SFSystem.stringToURl which will try to use the name as a URL,
 * or make a file URL to locate it. Otherwise the classloader's
 * getResourceAsStream is used to locate the include. Subclasses can override
 * this to do more sophisticated include storage. The format of an
 * AttributeList as returned by DefaultParser is a vector of Object[] with
 * element 0 the name of the attribute and element 1 the value.
 * </p>
 * To aid debugging of inclusion problems, if the system property defined in
 * {@link #SYSPROP_LOG_INCLUDES} is set to "true", inclusions will be printed out to System.out
 * It is logged at this level as inclusion needs to work for the SmartFrog logging framework, so
 * that cannot be used.
